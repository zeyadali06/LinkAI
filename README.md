# LinkAI

This project is a job-matching platform similar to LinkedIn or Wuzzuf, enhanced with an AI-powered voice interview feature. It helps employers assess communication skills through simulated interviews using speech analysis. The app is built with Flutter, and integrates custom AI models for voice-to-text, AI evaluation, and text-to-speech. It aims to improve hiring accuracy and candidate preparation.
